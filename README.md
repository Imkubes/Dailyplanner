# Dailyplanner

I want this to display the current date and time,
have a timeblock for scheduling
be able to enter data into the time block that saves my inputs upon refresh
upon the start of a new day i want my planner to be wiped clean to start fresh for the day

based on time of day, i want the past present and future to be color coded on my time blocks.
